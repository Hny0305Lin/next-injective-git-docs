# Acceptance Evidence

Scope note (updated 2026-10-05): the existing schema/gate described below
targets **legacy Suite v3 IPFS**, not the first mainnet successor.
[ADR 0004](adr/0004-mainnet-storage-neutral-successor-and-byos-scope.md) confirms
AWS S3 / R2 BYOS on a storage-neutral successor as the first mainnet scope.
Suite v4 is now implemented, deployed and active on Injective testnet, and a
real Cloudflare R2 end-to-end Git flow has passed (see the
[delivery record](backlog.md)); the successor evidence extension below is
therefore partially satisfied. Still NOT PROVEN: the real AWS S3 canary, the
remaining real-layer residuals, an extended v4-aware release gate, and the
security/approval gates. This document does not upgrade the gate or authorize
a deployment or public profile switch.

Repository tests demonstrate source behavior only. They are not deployment,
migration, finality, wallet, or operational evidence.

The cutover evidence directory must contain the exact files required by
`scripts/migration-cutover-readiness.sh`, all bound by
`cutover-evidence.sha256`. `cutover-approval.txt` binds an independent reviewer
to the exact 40-hex source commit and UTC review time.

`deployment.json` must be emitted by the no-clobber deployment tool, either
during live broadcast or through its strict read-only historical-recovery mode.
Historical recovery is accepted only when all 17 ordered deployment and
configuration transactions, exact input bytes, historical blocks, receipts,
runtime templates, and bindings validate. Separate
`blockscout-verification.json` proves all nine deployed addresses are verified.
`suite-verification.json` must be produced from fixed-block reads after
activation. The gate checks version 3, active state, source/chain/snapshot,
nine deployed contract receipts and code hashes, seven finalized module
bindings, and runtime hash equality. `cutover-scope.json` selects the evidence
branch. The accepted `fresh-empty-suite` branch requires zero module counts and
batches, matching empty roots, the activation journal, and username escrow
non-liability evidence; it does not require V1 migration artifacts. Common
required files still cover Solidity tests, clean Linux/Windows Git E2E, Web
receipts, security review, and the finality runbook.

Real testnet deployment, Blockscout, fresh-empty activation, and fixed-block
Suite evidence now exists under the local evidence directory. The public
SuiteDirectory profile remains empty until the remaining common evidence set is
reviewed and passes. Commit-bound P0 source/CI results are tracked separately in
[P0 Evidence Record](p0-evidence.md); they do not satisfy deployment, wallet,
finality, or cutover acceptance.

The current evidence schema covers the IPFS-backed v3 cutover only. It contains
no evidence for AWS S3 / R2 support. Preserve that schema and historical
evidence; do not change old receipts, ABI, suite version or checksums to make
them appear to verify a successor.

## Required Successor Evidence Extension (Partially Delivered 2026-10-05)

Delivered so far: frozen manifest schema 1 with Go/TS golden vectors; the v4
contracts/ABI/Go/Web decoders bound to one reviewed source set; a deployed
testnet successor with binding verification; and a real R2 end-to-end Git flow
with verified public GET/CORS. Still required before successor publication:

- Freeze the manifest encoding/schema and Go/TypeScript golden vectors;
  attest exact manifest digest/size, pack raw SHA-256/size and context binding.
- Bind successor version, contract source/artifacts, ABI, Go/Web/indexer
  decoders, Directory/module hashes and the new evidence schema to one commit.
- Separate local mock/fixture results from real AWS and real R2 receipts and
  read-back checks; show conditional duplicates/conflicts, limits, supported
  multipart behavior, independent reader permissions, public GET and CORS.
- Show no-Kubo clean Windows/Linux Git workflows and public Web reads on the
  deployed successor, including new refs, force, deletion, fork/context,
  same-commit manifest changes, CAS conflicts and uncertain receipt/reorg recovery.
- Record source→pack→manifest→transaction→verified-read causality without
  credentials, signed URLs or tokens. Include provider costs/resource scope
  and the explicit authorizations used for canaries and transactions.
- A fresh successor needs its own bootstrap/activation scope. Existing v3
  import receipts are required only if that import was separately selected;
  CosmWasm V1 migration is not inferred.
- Retain independent security, governance, finality, approval and checksum
  gates. A PASS from the current v3 gate cannot approve successor publication.

Detailed layer exits are in [S01–S07](backlog.md), the
[BYOS specification](storage-byos.md) and [roadmap](delivery-roadmap.md).
Managed brokers, private repositories, compulsory dual copies and automatic
cleanup are not first-release evidence requirements.
