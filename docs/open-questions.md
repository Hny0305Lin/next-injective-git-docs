# Open Decisions

Updated: 2026-10-05 (Asia/Shanghai). The first-release product decisions below
were confirmed by the user on 2026-09-13 and are now delivered as Suite v4
(BYOS): the successor suite is deployed on Injective testnet, CLI/Web dispatch
by version, and real R2 end-to-end flows pass. What remains open is listed
below (real AWS canary, successor publication evidence, mainnet governance).
See [ADR 0004](adr/0004-mainnet-storage-neutral-successor-and-byos-scope.md)
and the [BYOS specification](storage-byos.md).

## Already Decided — Do Not Reopen For The First Release

- Object storage is a first mainnet requirement: directly target a
  storage-neutral successor, not an IPFS-only v3 mainnet intermediate release.
- Only user-owned Amazon S3 and Cloudflare R2 buckets. No MinIO, self-hosted
  object stores, other clouds or arbitrary S3-compatible write endpoint.
- Public repositories first; private repositories, E2EE and key distribution
  are later work. Private bucket access alone is not a privacy guarantee.
- Users pay their cloud costs. One verified object location suffices; dual
  replicas and managed public storage are not mandatory release conditions.
- Authenticated readers use independent user-owned configuration; no managed
  GET broker or writer-secret sharing. Anonymous Web access requires public
  read configuration/CORS and cannot be inferred from authenticated CLI tests.
- Canonical JSON, using RFC 8785 JCS as the implementation baseline, not CBOR.

## Engineering Decisions Frozen Through S01–S05 (Delivered As Suite v4)

These decisions were frozen during S01–S05 and are now implemented and tested
in the delivered v4 suite; do not reopen them without a new successor version.
The specification's recommended defaults were applied, local fixtures were
implemented, and justified deviations were recorded before freezing the wire
protocol.

- Manifest schema 1/canonical bytes/context binding and local limits are now tested and frozen in [BYOS section 9](storage-byos.md): SHA-1, pack v2, full non-thin history. Other Git formats and incremental dependency optimization remain separate work. Incremental dependency packs were approved by the user on 2026-10-05 and scheduled as [S08](adr/0005-incremental-packs-via-manifest-schema-2.md): manifest schemaVersion 2 on the existing Suite v4, no contract change; schema 1 manifests stay valid.
- Successor version, bounded bootstrap locator/state layout, same-commit
  manifest changes, CAS revision/tombstones, ref deletion/recreation, fork and
  import semantics, event ABI and backwards-compatible client dispatch.
- Provider/credential reference UX and safe endpoint validation; exact cloud
  region/account constraints and public read domain rules. No generic endpoint
  escape hatch to make local mocks easier.
- Local provider limits are frozen: 16 MiB single PUT for AWS/R2, AWS-only 8 MiB
  multipart parts up to 512 MiB, full readback and directed recovery. Real R2
  conditional completion and full-chain Git evidence are now PASS; the real
  AWS S3 canary and its cost/interruption evidence remain NOT PROVEN.
  Missing real evidence results in explicit feature/size limits, not an
  assumed compatibility claim.
- Resource policy documentation: least-privilege writer/reader identities,
  stable public GET/CORS, secret redaction, safe lifecycle warnings and
  optional retention/versioning. Do not make a feature unavailable on one
  provider an unreviewed common requirement.
- Versioned successor indexer/evidence gate support. Existing scripts marked
  FAIL and v3-only release gates cannot silently authorize successor use.

## Decisions Requiring User Resources Or Separate Scope

- Which disposable AWS/R2 test buckets/prefixes, public domains/origins,
  permissions, cost limits and upload ranges may be used for real canaries?
  Credentials must be configured by the user through a secure local channel,
  never pasted into chat or recovered from existing secret files.
- Whether any **existing v3 testnet history** should be imported into a new
  successor. Default recommendation: validate a fresh successor first. This
  is separate from the already-decided mainnet successor target; V1 remains
  read-only archive preview and is not automatically imported.
- Scope of any real testnet deployments/transactions, signing environment and
  funds. Funds have not been checked; do not assert insufficiency. This
  documentation/prompt grants no such authorization.
- Any future object deletion, incomplete-upload abort, lifecycle cleanup or
  historical unpin needs an explicit inventory/scope, recovery policy and
  authorization, not an implicit step after a successful ref update.

## Production Governance And Evidence Gates

- Define multisig membership, quorum, emergency powers and timelock policy.
- Approve INJ platform fee and treasury policy from reviewed constructor evidence.
- Approve username original-owner claim duration and public communication only
  with the required escrow/non-liability evidence for the selected scope.
- Select finality depth, RPC/reorg thresholds and recovery procedures.
- Establish key rotation, offline backup and deployment/operator separation.
- Define evidence retention and independent reviewers authorized to sign the
  exact commit/hash-bound release approval.
- Complete successor security review and both providers' native Git/Web
  acceptance before publishing a mainnet or successor public profile.

## Later Product Work — Not First-Release BYOS Blockers

- Optional dual replicas, managed public profiles, provider failover and who
  pays for any platform-operated copy/bandwidth.
- Private repositories, E2EE, per-reader key distribution/revocation, metadata
  leakage and private Web access. The choice of independent readers does not
  itself solve those problems.
- Additional cloud providers or self-hosted services, each with independent
  capability/security acceptance.
- Incremental pack dependencies moved to scheduled work on 2026-10-05
  ([S08](adr/0005-incremental-packs-via-manifest-schema-2.md), user decision:
  manifest schemaVersion 2 on the existing Suite v4, no contract change).
  Still later work: chain compaction/merging, safe inventory-based orphan
  cleanup, retention/disaster-recovery service commitments.
- Whether ZKP remains an isolated testnet experiment or becomes a separately
  reviewed successor requirement, with root governance, setup, verifier/circuit
  audits, privacy and replay/front-running controls.

No fixture, previous deployment or document checkbox can decide these matters
or prove their implementation. See [the roadmap](delivery-roadmap.md) and
[S01–S07 backlog](backlog.md) for actual exit conditions.
